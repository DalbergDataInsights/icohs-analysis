### Context

<br>

**This project was developed under the Intelligence Community Health Systems initiative** (iCoHS), a partnership between the **Rockefeller** Foundation and **UNICEF** which aims to support the Government of **Uganda Ministry of Health** (MoH) to use data to strengthen community health systems.  The tool was developed by **Dalberg Data Insights**.

**This tool provides access to clean, time-consistent data on continuity of health services** before, during, and after the COVID-19 crisis. It addresses three key challenges faced by the MoH.
- **Time continuity**. At the beginning of 2020, the Ministry upgraded its health information systems (DHIS2), creating a discontinuity between the 2018/2019 data and 2020 data. While the process of matching datasets is ongoing as of early 2021, our tool provides the ability to link both datasets in order to assess long term trends.
- **Data quality**. The data quality assurance mechanism at the Ministry relies on a thorough, decentralized process, limiting the ability to quickly discard outliers while they are being investigated. Our tool provides an automated process of outlier replacement to be able to approximate trends in the meantime.
- **Data visualization**. The DHIS2 system includes a wide range of customizable visualization, but no ready-to-use dashboard adaptable across metrics. Our tool enables users to explore DHIS2 data intuitively, from the national to the facility level.
